Assurance:

* The team created necessary acceptance criteria for each user story and therefore each function that needed implementation. This was determined by what we can accurately test and confirm the correct implementation of all functions. This was discussed thoroughly through standups so that we did not miss any criteria for any of our function
* The team wrote thorough tests all ensuring that all errors (ValueErrors and AccessErrors) are covered and through the use of pytest coverage, we guaranteed that out code had perfect coverage and all errors currently known are accounted for to the best of our abilities. Certain assumptions were made based on certain function and additional tests were added as they seemed necessary but were not mentioned in the specification
* The team also made sure that the code which we wrote followed industry-standard styles by going through, with pylint, all of our code and ensuring that the function all follow said styles. Every function is clearly labeled with docstrings and so they can be quickly understood without the need to read the whole function. This was also useful when working as a team to better understand how each function of various function groups was to work together
