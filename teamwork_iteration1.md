Reflection:

During the first iteration, many of the team members naturally fell into various roles which made the team work well. While there are the occasional communication error and delay, nearly all team members worked well and communicated the best we can. The messaging group created was extremely helpful when it came to clarification and we the virtual standups which we have done ensure that everybody was on target for the deadline.

In the planning stage, those who had experience in creating user stories and tests created templates and examples which the rest of the team successfully use and follow. This was to ensure that the entire project follow a constant style and structure so when it came to reviewing each other's work, it was easy well structured and coherent. We decided on a more comprehensive style when it came to writing the tests where everything is fully documented, from the function names, examples of input output data and a written description on what each function and test did. Due to the fact that team was unfamiliar with each other's style or thought process, this simplified the review process as each function can be easily understood and fixed if required

The method of constantly reviewing and the feedback loop which that created made sure that all the user stories and code were correctly written and implemented. The specification was thoroughly read over by every member to ensure no misunderstanding. However, there are occasional miscommunication between members when it came to certain vague terms within the specification which caused some confusion and may lead to time wasted to discussion.

Overall, the team came together very well and smoothly during this first iteration. Every member executed task they were assigned during the planning stage the best as they can. Each members strengths came in useful during the execution and we followed a well-documented structure that ensure no misunderstanding with each others code. Miscommunication was quickly remedied through virtual standups and the task was completed to a satisfactory standard.
