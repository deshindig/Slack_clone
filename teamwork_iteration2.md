Teamwork:

When working on iteration 2, the team incorporated several strategies to help proceed in an organised manner and ensuring no team member was too far behind.

Firstly, during our first standup together, we laid out the format and naming scheme which will be used along for the project. This ensured that everybody was up to date and understood how data was to be stored, the data type stored, and therefore how they will be accessed. We all stuck with said naming scheme to ensure coherency.

Secondly, We then assign ourselves to various components of the project based on the function group (Messages, Channels, user, etc), and focused primarily on the dependent functions (message_send, channel_create, auth_user, etc.) Once that was completed, we continued with our project the way we laid out in iteration 1.

Due to schedule conflicts, we rarely were able to do full standups with the team, instead, we used asynchronous standups between team members to ensure everybody is up to date. Beyond that, we also would create group calls between team members, especially when we were working larger and dependency heavy functions. When it came near the end where time constraints became more apparent, we started using story points to assign functions to help with prioritising work.

One big problem which we did encounter was during testing phases of more complex functions, due to their dependency on other functions, we found that our function did not communicate well either retrieving the wrong information or from wrong data location. We worked on this more traditionally as a team, by having members go line by line on each function and ensuring all the data is correctly outputted.

We typically met for standups three times a week and around four to five times nearer to the deadline. This was to ensure that nobody was falling behind on implementation and that everybody always had a good idea of what the progress of the project was like. We ensured that every team member knew two things. First, where every other team member was at the moment in the project, and second, the issues and errors that other members were facing so we could fix the problem collaboratively.

When multiple people were working on the same code, we utilised pair programming so that we could learn various creative methods of approaching and implementing a function. This also helped better our understanding of certain functions given that some members had a better understanding based on their pre-assigned function group.

Finally, I believe that for iteration 2, the team function accordingly to the best of our abilities. Certain parts could have been more thoroughly talked about earlier to prevent mistakes whereas certain other parts were too overly discussed. In the end, we worked collaboratively where possible to achieve an outcome to the standards of the team.
